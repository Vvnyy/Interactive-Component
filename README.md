FrontEndMentor challenge solved with CSS flexbox and JS

I'm glad I did this project, it took me a few days studying to solve the JS part, which I still don't master (to be honest, I don't even master CSS yet so it's ok lol).

Any criticism and alternative way to solve this project will be welcome on my Front End Mentor profile.
